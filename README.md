#Interactive resume

DEMO [here](https://frontendsara.github.io/resume-lab/).

In this project, I designed my own resume whit HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

For mobile and tablet use I created a hamburger menu that can take the reader to each section of my page.
In desktop mode, the reader finds the headlines of each section displayed on top of the page.
The content that follows is a description of myself, further down my projects, and at the bottom of the page a footer with contact alternatives.
