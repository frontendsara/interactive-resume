#Interactive resume

DEMO [here](https://frontendsara.github.io/interactive-resume/).

In this project, I designed my own resume whit HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

For mobile and tablet use I created a hamburger menu that can take the user to each section of my page.
In desktop mode, the user finds the headlines of each section displayed on top of the page.
The content that follows is a description of myself, further down my projects, and at the bottom of the page a footer with contact alternatives.

I borrowed the function "revealContent" from [here](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-animations-scroll/). This is a function to reveal content when user scroll on the page.
